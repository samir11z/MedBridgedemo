"""
apps/ml-service/app/services/seed_service.py

Generates starter transaction/inventory history for a brand-new hospital
that just signed up, using the SAME simulation engine as the bulk generator
(training/generate_ledger_data.py), just scoped to one hospital instead of
all 42-ish reference hospitals.

Returns plain Python data (lists of dicts) — this service does NOT write to
Postgres itself. The Node backend calls this endpoint, gets the data back,
and writes it into the real database, tagging it isSynthetic=True.
